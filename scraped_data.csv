The room comes with a massive ensuite bathroom (private) with both a shower and bathtub. The flat features a great living/TV room as well as a large kitchen with new and built-in appliances as well as a separate dining area that easily fits six. The building also has a massive private garden that we all use when the sun is out. The flat has a separate coat/storage room (as well as plenty of storage space in the kitchen) and separate washer and dryer. The flat is always kept clean since we have a fortnightly cleaner for both bathrooms and shared living areas. Monthly bills come to circa Â£120 a month/pp.   It's located on a quiet tree-lined street, with a few restaurants and shops just a few steps away. Both Maida Vale station (5 minute walk) and Warwick Avenue station (7 min) service the area with access to the Bakerloo line (Zone 2). It's an amazing area with plenty of shops, restaurants, green spaces and regents canal on your door step as well as Little Venice.

You'll be chatting to me at first and I'll then arrange for a chat with my flatmates if you're interested.  The lease is up in January 2023 but it's quite likely that the break clause in our contract will be activated six months earlier as Joel and Henrik are both keen on buying their own flats. I'm also open to selling my desk, wall-mounted 42'' inch UHD Smart-TV and Sonos speaker for a good price, as I'm moving to the other side of the world.
